## Motivation

Modernator is intended to be a generic platform for moderating proposals. In
this context, moderation simply means that the proposal has been handled and
does not need further attention. What follows are some concrete examples:

* Moderating a Question and Answer session
* Choosing the favorite place to go for lunch
* Ranking team names

The underlying engine and data model is the same for these cases. Only the
presentation differs.
