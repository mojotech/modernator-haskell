# Gherkins

The files in this directory are specifications of the behavior of Modernator
written in Gherkin syntax. These can be used as executable documentation by
implementations or as simple references for implementation.

The documents can be read in any order, but it is probably most useful to start
with [Users](Users.feature) or [Sessions](Sessions.feature). Each document
contains cross-references to other documents when relevant.

The documents are intended to form a complete specification of the behavior of
Modernator such that a new implementation can be built just from referencing
these documents. That being said they may contain mistakes, so any omissions,
corrections, etc. are welcome.
